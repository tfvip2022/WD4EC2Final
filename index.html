    <h1>Nature in Hong Kong</h1>
  </header>
  <main id="MainIndex">
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> is one of the financial centers in the world.
      Though famous for the skyscrapers in the city, Hong Kong is also a place full of beautiful nature
      scenery. This site includes two of my favourite activities to explore the nature, hiking and birdwatching. </p>

    <p>Usually, I walk the hiking trail to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Peak">Victoria Peak</a>
      on weekends.
      It's an easy one and near my home. If with more time, I will walk the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon%27s_Back">Dragon's Back</a> with my friends.
      But it's quite exhausting and far from my home.</p>

    <p>I also like to see the wild birds in the park. Despite its small size, Hong Kong is teeming with bird life. Bird
      watching provides a path leading to our communication with nature, and enables us to share the enjoyment from the
      appreciation of birds.</p>
